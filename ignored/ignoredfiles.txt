If I have to ignore any files locally I can type the file name in the .gitignore
There can be .gitignore files inside directories, 
If i have to remove any file or that has to ignored but is on remote. I will type git rm --cached <filename>
Then add it to staging and commit it and push the code to remote. The files are returned back to local
