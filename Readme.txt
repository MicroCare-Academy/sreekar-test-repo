We create a repo locally 
with git init
later added .gitignore
Later added readme.txt
Now the git ignore.txt files can be ignored from sending to the remote
git add will help to bring the modified files for staging
git commit will create the snapshot of staging files
post this we have to push the git to remote through git push --set-upstream origin master
this step if for git configuration check with jenkins
